# Maze Solver

Simple maze solver built in Python. Features a minimalist graphic display. Automatically generates a maze and solves it using the DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm.

## Features

* Generates a random maze
* Displays it graphically
* Solves the maze using the DFS algorithm
* Displays the solution during the solving process, showcasing how the algorithm works

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/igorplebanczyk/maze-solver.git
    ```
2. Confirm that Python 3 is installed
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```

3. Install Tkinter
    ```bash
    pip install tk
    ```

## Usage

Run the script
```bash
python -m maze-solver
```

## Notes

* Recommended Python version: `3.10` or higher
* Originally built as part of a guided project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-maze-solver-python), but has since been improved
* It was primarily built as a learning exercise
